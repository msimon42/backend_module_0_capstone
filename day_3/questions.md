## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
    A conditional statement is a set of instructions for a computer to follow based on whether a statement evaluates to true or false.
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
If statements can be used to give the user feedback based on different inputs. For example, an online quiz informs a user if they are right or wrong based on their answer, and a form might throw an error if the user enters an invalid email address. Another example would be a dating app allowing two people to contact each other if they show mutual interest.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
    ```
    if <condition>
      <code executed if condition is true>
    end
    ```  
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
   Simply state another condition on a new line, and specify what action should be taken if that condition is true.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```
   if <condition>
      <code executed if condition is true>
   elsif <another condition>
      <code executed if condition is true and above conditions are not true>
   else
      <code executed if none of the above conditions are true>
   end     
```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
    Another way to use a conditional statement is to run a loop until a certain condition is no longer met.
